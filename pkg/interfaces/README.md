This package contains interfaces used in dependent packages, which makes building systems that interact with Balancer contracts simpler, as the implementation information is not included.

## Overview

### Installation

$ npm install @balancer-labs/v3-interfaces
```

### Usage

This package can be used in multiple ways, including interacting with already deployed Pools, or performing local testing. It contains all interfaces used in the system, from the foundational [Vault](contracts/vault/IVault.sol) to very specific contracts.
